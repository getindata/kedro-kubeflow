# GCP AI Platform support

Google Cloud's AI Platform offers couple services that simplify Machine Learning 
tasks with use of Kubeflow based components.

### Using `kedro` with AI Platform Notebooks

[AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks) provides 
an easy way to manage and host JupyterLab based data science workbench environment.
What we've found out is that the default images provided by a service cause some
dependency conflicts. To avoid this issues make sure you use isolated virtual
environment, e.g. [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/). New virtual 
environment can be created by simply invoking `python -m virtualenv venv` command.

### Using `kedro-kubeflow` with AI Platform Pipelines

[AI Platform Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/introduction)
is a service that allows to easily deploy [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/overview/pipelines-overview/)
on new or existing Google Kubernetes Engine clusters. 

In general `kedro-kubeflow` plugin should work with AI Platform Pipelines out of 
the box, with the only exception is that it requires authentication. Note that the `host` 
variable should point to a dashboard URL generated by AI Platform Pipelines service 
(e.g. https://653hddae86eb7b0-dot-europe-west1.pipelines.googleusercontent.com/), 
just open the dashboard from the [service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/clusters)
and copy url from the browser. 

Below is the list of authentication scenarios supported so far: 

##### 1. Connecting to AI Pipelines from AI Platform Notebooks
In this scenario authentication works out of the box with _default credentials_ 
mechanism. 

##### 2. Authentication to AI Pipelines from local environment
To interact with AI Platform Pipelines from local environment you can use the 
mechanisms provided by [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk). After
installing the SDK run `google cloud application-default login` to initialize 
_default credentials_ on your local machine. 

You can use service account key for authentication as well. To make that work just 
set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of where the
service account key file is stored.    

##### 3. Authenticating through IAP Proxy
[Identity Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap) is a product that allows 
securing your cloud based applications with Google Identity. 

To authenticate with IAP find out which _oauth client ID_ is the proxy configured
with and then save it in `IAP_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. The authentication
should work seamlessly assuming identity you are using has been granted access to 
the application. 

The above will work if you are connecting from within GCP VM or locally with specified
service account credentials. It will *NOT* work for credentials obtained with `google
cloud application-default login`. 

### Using `kedro-kubeflow` with Vertex AI Pipelines (DEPRECATED)

Vertex AI Pipelines support in `kedro-kubeflow` has been deprecated in favor of the
new plugin [kedro-vertexai](https://kedro-vertexai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

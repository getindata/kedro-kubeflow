# Quickstart

## Preprequisites

The quickstart assumes user have access to Kubeflow Pipelines deployment. Pipelines can be dedployed on any Kubernetes cluster, including [local cluster](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/installation/localcluster-deployment/).

## Install the toy project with Kubeflow Pipelines support

It is a good practice to start by creating a new virtualenv before installing new packages. Therefore, use `virtalenv` command to create new env and activate it:

```console
$ virtualenv venv-demo
created virtual environment CPython3.8.5.final.0-64 in 145ms
  creator CPython3Posix(dest=/home/mario/kedro/venv-demo, clear=False, no_vcs_ignore=False, global=False)
  seeder FromAppData(download=False, pip=bundle, setuptools=bundle, wheel=bundle, via=copy, app_data_dir=/home/mario/.local/share/virtualenv)
    added seed packages: pip==20.3.1, setuptools==51.0.0, wheel==0.36.2
  activators BashActivator,CShellActivator,FishActivator,PowerShellActivator,PythonActivator,XonshActivator
$ source venv-demo/bin/activate
```

Then, `kedro` must be present to enable cloning the starter project, along with the latest version of `kedro-kubeflow` plugina and kedro-docker (required to build docker images with the Kedro pipeline nodes):

```
$ pip install 'kedro<0.17' kedro-kubeflow kedro-docker
```

With the dependencies in place, let's create a new project:

```
$ kedro new --starter=git+https://github.com/getindata/kedro-starter-spaceflights.git --checkout allow_nodes_with_commas
Project Name:
=============
Please enter a human readable name for your new project.
Spaces and punctuation are allowed.
 [New Kedro Project]: Kubeflow Plugin Demo

Repository Name:
================
Please enter a directory name for your new project repository.
Alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
Lowercase is recommended.
 [kubeflow-plugin-demo]: 

Python Package Name:
====================
Please enter a valid Python package name for your project package.
Alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed.
Lowercase is recommended. Package name must start with a letter or underscore.
 [kubeflow_plugin_demo]: 

Change directory to the project generated in /home/mario/kedro/kubeflow-plugin-demo

A best-practice setup includes initialising git and creating a virtual environment before running `kedro install` to install project-specific dependencies. Refer to the Kedro documentation: https://kedro.readthedocs.io/
```

> TODO: switch to the official `spaceflights` starter after https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-starter-spaceflights/pull/10 is merged

Finally, go the demo project directory and ensure that kedro-kubeflow plugin is activated:

```console
$ cd kubeflow-plugin-demo/
$ kedro install
(...)
Requirements installed!
$ kedro kubeflow --help

```

## Build the docker image to be used on Kubeflow Pipelines runs

First, initialize the project with `kedro-docker` configuration by running:

```
$ kedro docker init
```

This command creates a several files, including `.dockerignore`. This file ensures that transient files are not included in the docker image and it requires small adjustment. Open it in your favourite text editor and extend the section `# except the following` by adding there:

```console
!data/01_raw
```

This change enforces raw data existence in the image. Also, one of the limitations of running the Kedro pipeline on Kubeflow (and not on local environemt) is inability to use MemoryDataSets, as the pipeline nodes do not share memory, so every artifact should be stored as file. The `spaceflights` demo configures four datasets as in-memory, so let's change the behaviour by adding these lines to `conf/base/catalog.yml`:

```console
X_train:
  type: pickle.PickleDataSet
  filepath: data/05_model_input/X_train.pickle
  layer: model_input

y_train:
  type: pickle.PickleDataSet
  filepath: data/05_model_input/y_train.pickle
  layer: model_input

X_test:
  type: pickle.PickleDataSet
  filepath: data/05_model_input/X_test.pickle
  layer: model_input

y_test:
  type: pickle.PickleDataSet
  filepath: data/05_model_input/y_test.pickle
  layer: model_input
```

Finally, build the image:

```console
kedro docker build
```

When execution finishes, your docker image is ready. If you don't use local cluster, you should push the image to the remote repository:

```console
docker tag kubeflow_plugin_demo:latest remote.repo.url.com/kubeflow_plugin_demo:latest
docker push remote.repo.url.com/kubeflow_plugin_demo:latest
```

## Run the pipeline on Kubeflow

First, run `init` script to create the sample configuration. A parameter value should reflect the kubeflow base path **as seen from the system** (so no internal Kubernetes IP unless you run the local cluster):

```console
kedro kubeflow init https://kubeflow.cluster.com
(...)
Configuration generated in /home/mario/kedro/kubeflow-plugin-demo/conf/base/kubeflow.yaml
```

Then, if needed, adjust the `conf/base/kubeflow.yaml`. For example, the `image:` key should point to the full image name (like `remote.repo.url.com/kubeflow_plugin_demo:latest` if you pushed the image at this name). Depending on the storage classes availability in Kubernetes cluster, you may want to modify `volume.storageclass` and `volume.access_modes` (please consult with Kubernetes admin what values should be there).

Finally, everything is set to run the pipeline on Kubeflow. Run `upload-pipeline`:

```console
$ kedro kubeflow upload-pipeline
2021-01-12 09:47:35,132 - kedro_kubeflow.kfpclient - INFO - No IAP_CLIENT_ID provided, skipping custom IAP authentication
2021-01-12 09:47:35,209 - kedro_kubeflow.kfpclient - INFO - Pipeline created
2021-01-12 09:47:35,209 - kedro_kubeflow.kfpclient - INFO - Pipeline link: https://kubeflow.cluster.com/#/pipelines/details/9a3e4e16-1897-48b5-9752-d350b1d1faac/version/9a3e4e16-1897-48b5-9752-d350b1d1faac
```

As you can see, the pipeline was compiled and uploaded into Kubeflow. Let's visit the link:

![Uploaded pipeline](uploaded_pipeline.png)

The Kubeflow pipeline reflects the Kedro pipeline with two extra steps:

 * `data-volume-create` - creates an empty volume in Kubernetes cluster as a persistence layer for inter-steps data access
 * `data-volume-init` - initialized the volume with `01_raw` data when the pipeline starts

By using `Create run` button you can start a run of the pipeline on the cluster. A run behaves like `kedro run` command, but the steps are executed on the remote cluster. The outputs are stored on the persistent volume, and passed as the inputs accordingly to how Kedro nodes need them.

![Pipeline run](pipeline_run.gif)

From the UI you can access the logs of the execution. If everything seems fine, use `schedule to create a recurring run:

```console
$ kedro kubeflow schedule --cron-expression '0 0 4 * * *'
(...)
2021-01-12 12:37:23,086 - kedro_kubeflow.kfpclient - INFO - No IAP_CLIENT_ID provided, skipping custom IAP authentication
2021-01-12 12:37:23,096 - root - INFO - Creating experiment Kubeflow Plugin Demo.
2021-01-12 12:37:23,103 - kedro_kubeflow.kfpclient - INFO - New experiment created: 2123c082-b336-4093-bf3f-ce73f68b66b4
2021-01-12 12:37:23,147 - kedro_kubeflow.kfpclient - INFO - Pipeline scheduled to 0 0 4 * * *
```

You can see that the new experiment was created (that will group the runs) and the pipeline was scheduled. Please note, that Kubeflow uses 6-places cron expression (as opposite to Linux's cron with 5-places), where first place is the second indicator.

# Configuration

Plugin maintains the configuration in the `conf/base/kubeflow.yaml` file. Sample configuration can be generated using `kedro kubeflow init`:

```yaml
# Base url of the Kubeflow Pipelines, should include the schema (http/https)
host: https://kubeflow.example.com/pipelines

# Configuration used to run the pipeline
run_config:

  # Name of the image to run as the pipeline steps
  image: kubeflow-plugin-demo

  # Pull pilicy to be used for the steps. Use Always if you push the images
  # on the same tag, or Never if you use only local images
  image_pull_policy: IfNotPresent

  # Name of the kubeflow experiment to be created
  experiment_name: Kubeflow Plugin Demo

  # Name of the run for run-once
  run_name: Kubeflow Plugin Demo Run

  # Optional pipeline description
  description: Very Important Pipeline

  # Flag indicating if the run-once should wait for the pipeline to finish
  wait_for_completion: False

  # Optional volume specification
  volume:

    # Storage class - use null (or no value) to use the default storage
    # class deployed on the Kubernetes cluster
    storageclass: # default

    # The size of the volume that is created. Applicable for some storage
    # classes
    size: 1Gi

    # Access mode of the volume used to exchange data. ReadWriteMany is
    # preferred, but it is not supported on some environements (like GKE)
    # Default value: ReadWriteOnce
    #access_modes: [ReadWriteMany]

    # Flag indicating if the data-volume-init step (copying raw data to the
    # fresh volume) should be skipped
    skip_init: False

    # Allows to specify user executing pipelines within containers
    # Default: root user (to avoid issues with volumes in GKE)
    owner: 0

  # Optional section allowing adjustment of the resources
  # reservations and limits for the nodes
  resources:

    # For nodes that require more RAM you can increase the "memory"
    data_import_step:
      memory: 2Gi

    # Training nodes can utilize more than one CPU if the algoritm
    # supports it
    model_training:
      cpu: 8
      memory: 1Gi

    # GPU-capable nodes can request 1 GPU slot
    tensorflow_step:
      nvidia.com/gpu: 1

    # Default settings for the nodes
    __default__:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 64Mi
```

## Dynamic configuration support

`kedro-kubeflow` contains hook that enables [TemplatedConfigLoader](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kedro.config.TemplatedConfigLoader.html).
It allows passing environment variables to configuration files. It reads all environment variables following `KEDRO_CONFIG_<NAME>` pattern, which you 
can later inject in configuration file using `${name}` syntax. 

There are two special variables `KEDRO_CONFIG_COMMIT_ID`, `KEDRO_CONFIG_BRANCH_NAME` with support specifying default when variable is not set, 
e.g. `${commit_id|dirty}`

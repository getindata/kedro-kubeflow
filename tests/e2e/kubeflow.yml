  # Strategy used to generate Kubeflow pipeline nodes from Kedro nodes
  # Available strategies:
  #  * none (default) - nodes in Kedro pipeline are mapped to separate nodes
  #                     in Kubeflow pipelines. This strategy allows to inspect
  #                     a whole processing graph in Kubeflow UI and override
  #                     resources for each node (because they are run in separate pods)
  #                     Although, performance may not be optimal due to potential
  #                     sharing of intermediate datasets through disk.
  #  * full - nodes in Kedro pipeline are mapped to one node in Kubeflow pipelines.
  #           This strategy mitigate potential performance issues with `none` strategy
  #           but at the cost of degraded user experience within Kubeflow UI: a graph
  #           is collapsed to one node.

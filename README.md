## About

The main purpose of this plugin is to enable running kedro pipeline on Kubeflow Pipelines. It supports translation from 
Kedro pipeline DSL to [kfp](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/) (pipelines SDK) and deployment to 
a running kubeflow cluster with some convenient commands.

The plugin can be used together with `kedro-docker` to simplify preparation of docker image for pipeline execution.
